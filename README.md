# Simulating Ball Movement project

## Description
This is one of the projects I created in Week 2 of MITxPro Professional Certificate in Coding (Full Stack Dev). I used knowledge of JavaScript to create a ball that moved back and forth between invisible boundaries along the x- and y-axes. The ball changes direction based on the value of a Boolean called reverse, which will change its value when the ball reaches the edges of the boundary. When the value of reverse changes, the code changes whether it is adding or subtracting to move the ball, which changes its direction.
